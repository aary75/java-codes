binary tree is a non-linear and hierarchical data structure
types of node 
Root node 
leaf node
Parent Node
Child node 
Sibling node 
Ancestor Node 
Internal Node -: except root and leaf node
Descendant Node

Level 
Size -: No. of nodes 
Height -: Most commonly height is considered on the basis of edges(Total level - 1)
or if it is given you can also taken as (level == height)
No. of edges -: Size - 1


Types of trees:- 
1. Generic Trees -: Root node is one but no. of child node of one parent is not define

2. Binary Trees -: A parent have atmost 2 children

3. Binary Search Tree -: Tree in which every parent have atmost 2 children but condition
is that every left child is smaller than parent and every right child is greater than parent

4. AVL Trees -: These are binary search tree but these are balanced trees 

Applications of Tree Data Structure -: 
1. Hierarchical Tree Structure 
2. Searching Efficiency 
3. Sorting
4. Dynamic Data 
5. Efficient Insertion and Deletion
6. Easy to Implement
